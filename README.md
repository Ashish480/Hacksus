AI-Powered Autonomous Waste Segregation & Recycling Optimization

Introduction

In India, improper waste segregation and inefficient recycling systems contribute significantly to environmental pollution, landfill overflow, and resource wastage. Traditional waste management methods often fail due to a lack of automation, public awareness, and incentives for responsible disposal.

Our AI-powered solution leverages machine learning and image recognition to automate waste classification, ensuring effective segregation at the point of disposal. By integrating smart waste bins and a gamification-based reward system, we encourage responsible waste disposal while optimizing recycling efficiency.

Features

AI-Based Waste Classification: Utilizes YOLO-based object detection and a trained deep learning model to categorize waste into plastic, paper, organic, and hazardous materials.

Smart Waste Bins: Automated bins segregate waste accurately, minimizing human intervention.

Gamification & Rewards: Users earn eco-points for correct disposal, redeemable for discounts, donations, or incentives.

IoT Integration: Real-time data tracking enhances efficiency and monitoring.

Circular Economy Support: Segregated waste is directed to appropriate recycling industries.
