## 📋 Overview

A cutting-edge solution addressing India's waste management challenges through AI-powered classification, smart segregation, and incentive-based recycling systems.

### 🔍 The Problem

In India, improper waste segregation and inefficient recycling systems contribute significantly to:
- Environmental pollution
- Landfill overflow
- Resource wastage
- Health hazards

### 💡 Our Solution

Our system leverages machine learning, IoT, and gamification to create a sustainable, efficient waste management ecosystem.

    B --> C[Waste Segregation]
    C --> D[User Reward System]
    D --> E[Recycling Integration]
    E --> F[Analytics & Reporting]
```

1. **Image Capture**: Smart waste bins capture images of disposed items
2. **AI Classification**: System classifies waste using trained ML models
3. **Segregation & Sorting**: Waste automatically sorted into designated bins
4. **User Engagement**: Users earn eco-points via mobile app
5. **Recycling Integration**: Collected waste sent to appropriate recycling facilities
6. **Analytics**: Data used to optimize the system and measure environmental impact

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.8+
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended)
- ESP32 development board (for hardware implementation)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-waste-segregation.git
   cd ai-waste-segregation
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
